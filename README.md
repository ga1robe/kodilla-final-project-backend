# 3. RUNNING PROJECT LOCALLY

It is required to add your email address and password in the application.properties of the main and tests folder. Due to repository being public, this
data was removed for security reasons.


# 4. BUGS AND ISSUES

Idea for the project, design and execution of the project was performed within four weeks. I was driven by fulfillment of quantity requirements, trying to achieve in the time. Hence a lot some functionality may not work properly

Project uses free API's that have very limited amount of requests allowed.
